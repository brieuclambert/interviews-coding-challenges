about: How to open up a PR

---

Before you actually open your PR, make sure you've read the contributions guidelines for [new challenge](https://github.com/nfilzi/interviews-coding-challenges/blob/master/contribution-guidelines/how-to-contribute-new-challenges.md) or [improving an existing one](https://github.com/nfilzi/interviews-coding-challenges/blob/master/contribution-guidelines/how-to-contribute-to-existing-challenges.md), depending on what your goal is.

**Quick checks**
- [ ] Is your branch correctly named?
- [ ] In case you're pushing a new challenge, is your markdown file correctly named as well?

Cheers!
