## ‚ö†Ô∏è On the information shared in your new challenge ‚ö†Ô∏è

The whole point is to be able to share real challenges given by real companies.
But sometimes, companies would not agree with you sharing these.
And even worse, they sometimes include their names and other kind of information that
should stay private.

**Please, before submitting a PR, make sure you have the company's aggreement, and in any case, make sure to write sensitive information out!**
