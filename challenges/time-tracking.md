# Context

AB Tasty is a growing company accompanying hundreds of clients worldwide.
As teams and clients portfolios are expanding, we need to track the time our dedicated 
consultant spend with each of our clients. We used to write all of this on spreadsheets but 
it's getting hard to keep track of everything and to analyse all the data (more than 
100 000 lines every year). 

The operation team has been tasked to create a tool that will be used by all the consultants 
to track the time they spend with their clients.

# Goal

You'll cover some basics about API design.
As such, you'll focus only on the backend of the application.
Others will build apps later, using your API as backbone.

The following user stories describe what should be possible to do through this API:

- A consultant can sign up (only with an "@abtasty.com" e-mail address though)
- A consultant can view all the clients of AB Tasty
- A consultant can add a client to his portfolio
- A consultant can remove a client from his portfolio
- A consultant can register time, for a specific client
- A consultant can update a time entry he did in the past
- A consultant can delete a time entry he owns
- A consultant can view all the tasks he performed this calendar week

# Constraints

## Tooling

- You can use **Postman** to test out your API
- You can use any convenient gems you may need
- Your code must be available on **GitHub / Gitlab**

## Timeline

Our employees are expecting to be able to use this app in 1 week. Move fast hombre!
